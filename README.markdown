## Contributing

You're interested on contributing? Awesome! we need all the help we can! First lets figure out how you want to help:

#### Do you want to fix/contribute on the grammar file?
If you want to do so, please don't do it on the editor's branch! First do your changes on [grammar.source](https://github.com/kuroir/SCSS/blob/master/grammar.source) file which is located on this branch (master) and then paste the changes into the corresponding grammar file of your editor.

This is to avoid loosing documentation when the editors parse and rewrite the Grammar file and to keep them all in sync.

This means you'll need to do **two** pull requests: one on master and one on your editor.

#### Do you want to fix/contribute a Snippet/Command/Key Binding/Config?
Then do the changes on the branch of your editor; and send a pull request! The editor mantainer will review it and merge if it.

#### Want to be the mantainer of a Editor? We need you!
We're currently looking for people who can manage the following Editors:

- [E-TextEditor](https://github.com/kuroir/SCSS/tree/E-TextEditor)
- Chocolat
